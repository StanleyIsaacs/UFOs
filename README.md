# UFOs
## Overview
### We have been tasked by Dana to create a webpage that tracks UFO sightings to impress Nasa with whom she hopes to get a job. To do this we wil crete a webpage that can filter sightings by a variety of different variables including, date, city, shape of sighting and other options. We used html, javascript, vs code and bootstrap.

## Results
### Here is the site from the top so we can see what visitors are greeted by:

## An example of the filtering:

## Summary
### One drawback I see is the filters. I think we can get a better picture by adding filters to search for info like "has this sighting been disproved?" Also you kind of have to guess the filters. A drop down menu for some of the categories might be better. I would also recommend adding a clear button. The placeholders are a bit confusing. I would also like a way to filter to see if different cities had the same sighting so we can see how widespread it is.
